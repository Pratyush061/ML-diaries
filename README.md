Project Highlights:

🌟 Developed a predictive model to distinguish genuine disaster-related Tweets from non-disaster content.

🛠️ Leveraged advanced text preprocessing techniques using SpaCy's lemmatization for enhanced normalization.

🤖 Utilized BERT (en-cased-preprocess) for efficient data preprocessing and modeling, alongside traditional TF-IDF Vectorization with Naive Bayes for classification.

📊 Evaluated model performance using F1 Score and Confusion Matrix, offering insights into precision and recall.
